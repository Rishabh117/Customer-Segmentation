# Customer-Segmentation
This project focuses on customer segmentation using machine learning techniques to categorize customers based on their financial and behavioral traits. By segmenting customers, businesses can better understand their diverse needs and preferences, allowing for targeted marketing strategies and personalized customer experiences.

# Abstract
The project aims to enhance businesses' understanding of their customers by employing customer segmentation techniques. It involves categorizing customers based on factors such as spending habits, income levels, and demographic information. The segmentation is achieved through the implementation of various clustering algorithms, including K-means, Affinity Propagation, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN.

# Motivation
In today's competitive business landscape, understanding customer behavior and preferences is crucial for sustaining growth and profitability. By segmenting customers into distinct groups, businesses can tailor their marketing efforts, product offerings, and customer service initiatives to meet the specific needs of each segment. This project seeks to provide businesses with insights into their customer base through advanced machine learning techniques.

# Objectives
Implement various clustering algorithms for customer segmentation.
Analyze customer data to identify distinct segments based on financial and behavioral traits.
Evaluate the effectiveness of different clustering algorithms in segmenting customers.
Provide actionable insights and recommendations for businesses based on the segmented customer groups.
Implementation
The project utilizes Python programming language and popular libraries such as scikit-learn for implementing clustering algorithms. The dataset used for segmentation consists of customer information, including demographics, financial data, and spending behavior. The implementation involves data preprocessing, algorithm selection, model training, and evaluation.

# Directory Structure
data/: Contains the dataset used for customer segmentation.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks with the code for data preprocessing, algorithm implementation, and analysis.
scripts/: Python scripts for modular implementation of clustering algorithms.
